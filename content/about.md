My name is Paul Grillenberger and I'm a mathematician working as a programmer
pursuing music composition as a hobby.

# About maths

While I concentrated on learning applied maths through stochastics during my
bachelor's, I went on to learn more about the pure side of maths during my
master's (differential geometry) and while earning my doctoral degree
(algebraic topology). While the latter two phases enabled me to think
abstractly, to generalize solutions quickly and to see connections between
seemingly unrelated areas, the first phase accelerates my learning process
in Data Science, especially related to Machine Learning.

## Current projects

At the moment, I'm learning about the foundations of Machine
Learning, i.e., how to model the learning process mathematically, how to
evaluate whether a certain Machine Learning model might be superior over another
in certain circumstances and whether a certain problem is learnable at all.
One point that's most important is that Machine Learning is not the Holy Grail
that solves and automates every problem in existence. Machine Learning is most
useful when we're dealing with a problem that can be solved by experts, given
a sufficient amount of time to evaluate the data. If the evaluation is tedious
and takes a quite long time, Machine Learning might come in handy to
accelerate the process. Even so, it is obligatory to utilize a priori
information about the problem; a Machine Learning model trained with generic
data without any assumptions can only give very generic answers.

## Links and resources

I'm using the following resources:
- Hastie et. al. -- The Elements of Statistical Learning
- Bishop -- Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning

# About programming

I have been working as a software developer since October 2016 at [[https://collenda.com/de-en][Collenda
GmbH]], where I use Java and Oracle PL/SQL as my primary programming languages.
Programming has always fascinated me as it is the ideal companion to the more
abstract mathematical world; how I wished I could turn on a debugger and
change the values of certain variables to see how it turns out when I was
wading through an intriguing but intransparent proof deep inside an article
during my graduate studies! In fact, reading and changing code is very much
like reading an article and trying to apply its results to the problem you're
currently working on. In this metaphor, test driven development is quite
similar to the axiomatic approach I like to take when doing mathematics: You
don't immediately give an intransparent formula and work your way through
proofs by crunching numbers and equations, but you pin down the key aspects
and then construct a certain object that satisfies those. Extracting such key
aspects is as challenging as writing good tests because each test should pin
down one aspect of the feature you are trying to implement.

# About music

I have been writing songs since I was 14; being a self-taught guitarist and
singer, my musical journey started when I still went to primary school and
took E-Organ lessons for a few years. This enabled me to learn keyboard and,
finally, piano on my own. In recent years, I moved away from using the guitar
as my primary instrument for composition and like to use the piano as the central
piece in my songs. I've also started to rearrange some old songs of mine on
the piano.

### Setup for recording

- Software: Logic Pro X
- Hardware: Some 2012 iMac and the mixer / audio interface [Yamaha AG 03](https://de.yamaha.com/de/products/music_production/interfaces/ag_series/index.html).
- Vocals: An old Fame C010 recording microphone that I seek to replace in the
  near future.
